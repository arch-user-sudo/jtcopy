# jtcopy
A command line copy tool with a progress bar.

This was developed and tested on arch linux. Add the jtcopy file to "/usr/local/bin/" folder to use it. 
I'll post it on the AUR when i feel like its nessesary but for now It stays on github. 

If you've tested this and it works, and maybe you know how to make it a little better, feel free to contribute. 
As for the end users, I've kept it simple and basic so it'll always "Just Work". 

Thanks.
